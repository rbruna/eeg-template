Scripts to generate a BEM-based EEG template based on The NY Head

|   |
| :--- |
| **Note:** These scripts require FieldTrip (https://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org/). [^fieldtrip] | 

[^fieldtrip]: Any version _might_ work, but the current scripts have been tested using FieldTrip-20200130 and Matlab R2019b and R2024b.

This repository contains scripts developed (and, some times, compiled) in the [Laboratory of Cognitive and Computational Neuroscience](https://meg.ucm.es) in Madrid for the analysis of MEG and EEG data. Code based on others' is (or should be) referenced at the beginning of the code, and is (or should be) always based on Open Source code [^opensource].

[^opensource]: Althought not explicitely indicated in each code file, all new code present here is open source, publised under the GNU GPL v.3 license.

The code in this respository is strongly based on the [MEEG analysis repository](https://github.com/rbruna/meeg_analysis), in particular in section 2 (**Source reconstruction**). Most of the scripts in the repository are identical to those in MEEG analysis, a few of them have minor changes (which will be pointed out), and some will be new.

You can find a complete guide to this code in the [wiki](../../wiki).
